        Price trackers are great, like Tweakers, Kieskeurig, and others, but their search results are usually limited to a few webstores. Usually, this is because they get a kickback from their referrals.<br />
        Also, most items are not available on most price trackers. This is where TweakedTweakers comes in! ðŸŽ‰<br />
        <br />
        The goal was to create a web application that scrapes data for provided items, for provided webstores.<br />
        By creating an interface for it, we can also specify what items we want to scrape at that moment, and from which webstores.<br />
        Initially, the idea was to run a script and paste the data into a spreadsheet, but this was more fun.
